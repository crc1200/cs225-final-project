# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
As a team, we plan to meet at least once a week, preferably at a time when all group members can meet. We hope to have most of our meetings in person at a pre-determined location like the Grainger library. However, because it is more convenient we will also use Zoom to host virtual meetings when appropriate. Using a when2meet will be crucial in determining when everyone can meet each week. Additionally each member must have a general idea of the other members' schedule so we can plan additional meetings as needed.

2. **Assistance** 
We have already created a group chat to enhance communications. If a group member needs help with a task, they should reach out in this group chat asking for help. If no one member responds, the group member in trouble should then reach out to the other members individually. The member should expect a response from the other group members by the end of the day. It is important that as a team we create an environment that encourages asking for help when someone encounters a road block.

3. **Respect** 
All of our team members know each other pretty well and are comfortable voicing our opinions. All major decisions for the project will be discussed as a team and not made by a single individual. Active participation from all group members during team meetings is also very important so that each group member feels heard. Additionally, during every meeting each member should update the team on what they worked on over the week, any roadblocks and challenges they have encountered, and what they might need from the other team members.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
The first few meetings we have as a team will be where we do most of the planning and work distribution. During these meetings, each member will talk about their interests and goals for the project. If applicable, a member could mention the past experiences they have with a certain topic or algorithm to help the other members get a better understanding of the member's abilities. While we will assign some of the main components for the project, in the beginning, each member must be constantly updating other group members about how their specific task is going. If an aspect of the project is far more complex or trivial than previously expected, the group member must mention this during our meetings so another group member can provide assistance if needed.

5. **Time Commitment** 
 Every week will be different for the workload expected by each group member. When midterms are approaching or other assignments are due the expected hours will decrease. When other assignments are completed and the project is the only focus, the expected hours will certainly increase. As an average, it should be expected that each group member provides at least two hours of productive time spent working on the project. Some members are apart of professional fraternities that have a small weekly time commitment, which is why knowing each member's schedule is important. For the additional conflicts that inevitably occur, they will be addressed during the weekly meetings or through our team group chat. Because it is expected that each team member is actively checking in on this group chat, every member will be well informed about othes conflicts.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
For recurring conflicts such as a team member constantly being late, the other team members will need to directly address the individual during our meetings. Ideally, this will be done in person and in a relaxed manner, to avoid one member feeling attacked. In general, we must establish a team environment that does hold members accountable through weekly deliverables. In the case that there is a disagreement between team members, it may require us to defer to our mentor for a third-party opinion, however, this will be the last resort and instead, we will try to come to a mutual agreement that pleases all members.
